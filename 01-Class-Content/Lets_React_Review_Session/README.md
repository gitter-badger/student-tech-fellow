# Hello Friends!


## Let's React -- A deeper look at React with ES6



#### Are you ready to rock React ES6 style??


I dunno about you but it's got me feeling all:

We're going to get deep down into the nitty-gritty of React using ES6 and see
just how awesome a library react really is. We'll review some basic ES6 syntax
and why it can make things easier, especially with React. We'll also cover UDF
(User Defined Functions), Fat-Arrow Functions, In-Line conditionals, two-way data binding, as well as Component Lifecycles.

#### Getting Setup

There are two files in this repo under [Group_Challenges](https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/student-tech-fellow/tree/master/01-Class-Content/Lets_React_Review_Session/Group_Challenges/).
Please make sure to cd into __both__ and read the README.md file there.
It will tell you the commands you need to get started. These will be the exercises we work on together in group sessions.

#### Also

You will have a much better experience with two screens, if that means logging in from two computers by all means. We also ask that you please make sure you have your cameras and microphones on so we can hear and see you. To help you get setup with peripherals take a quick minute to also read [gettingStarted.md](https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/student-tech-fellow/tree/master/gettingStarted.md)
as a pre-flight checklist.

As with any review session make sure you bring your questions as well. This is the time to close those gaps in your understanding of React, JS ES6, and the View layer of the Stack.

With that said keep your arms and legs inside the vehicle at all times and let's fly.


#### By the End
By the end of this review I know you are going to feel like a React Master of the Universe and you'll know React so well you'll be telling people:
